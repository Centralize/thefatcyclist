## I am The Fat Cyclist!
Well here goes: I am Mikkel, i am 43 year old and for the past 15 years or so,
I have gained about 50 kgs. During 2020 alone I gained 20+ kgs.

## But why? pero ¿por qué?
I have been fighting an anxiety disorder, since 2002. This tour is part of
my fight against Anxiety and hopefully loose weight.
For the moment my anxiety has taken so much over that I am unable to drive a
car. Nor am I able to use public transport, unless I have taken some seriously
relaxing medicine, that really is not good for my overall health.
